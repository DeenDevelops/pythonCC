# pythonCC/pythonCrashCourse

The uploaded python code is based off of the exercies from Eric Matthes Python Crash Couse. I needed a refresher on python syntax, and Matthes book is an excellent way to go through the basics.
Currently, most of the exercises are finished. After I've uploaded the rest of the exercies, I will be switching to the projects section of the book. 

Python is a very versatile language, and I highly reccomend Matthes book.
