# pythonCC/pythonCrashCourse

The uploaded python code is based off of the exercies from Eric Matthes Python Crash Couse. I needed a refresher on python syntax, and Matthes book is an excellent refresher. Currently, most of the exercises are
finished. After I've finished the exercies, I will be switching to the projects section of the book. Python is a very versatile language and I reccomend everyone check out this book for a good refresher
of the basics.
